# **Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest**
This is my learning project on using machine learning model Random Forest Regressor, tuning its hyperparameters and saving final model for future use, all by making a pipeline. All requirements and dependencies are mentioned under "importing libraries" section in the source code file.

## **Source**
Data is available publicly on UCI machine learning repository and is provided by Elite Datascience on their course at link- https://elitedatascience.com/python-machine-learning-tutorial-scikit-learn

## **Problem Statement**
Predicting wine quality based on traits like acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol concentration.
